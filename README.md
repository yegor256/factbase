This Ruby gem manages an in-memory database of facts.
A fact is simply a map of properties and values.
The values are either atomic literals or non-empty sets of literals.
It is possible to delete a fact, but impossible to delete a property
from a fact.

**ATTENTION**: The current implemention is naive and,
because of that, **very slow**. I will be very happy
if you suggest a better implementation without the change of the interface.
The `Factbase::query()` method is what mostly needs performance optimization:
currently it simply iterates through all facts in the factbase in order
to find those that match the provided terms. Obviously,
even a simple indexing may significantly increase performance.

Here is how you use it (it's thread-safe, by the way):

```ruby
fb = Factbase.new
f = fb.insert
f.kind = 'book'
f.title = 'Object Thinking'
fb.query('(eq kind "book")').each do |f|
  f.seen = true
end
fb.insert
fb.query('(not (exists seen))').each do |f|
  f.title = 'Elegant Objects'
end
```

You can save the factbase to the disc and then load it back:

```ruby
file = '/tmp/simple.fb'
f1 = Factbase.new
f = f1.insert
f.foo = 42
File.save(file, f1.export)
f2 = Factbase.new
f2.import(File.read(file))
assert(f2.query('(eq foo 42)').each.to_a.size == 1)
```

There are some boolean terms available in a query
(they return either `true` or `false`):

* `(always)` and `(never)` are `true` and `false`
* `(nil v)` is `true` if `v` is `nil`
* `(not b)` is the inverse of `b`
* `(or b1 b2 ...)` is `true` if at least one argument is `true`
* `(and b1 b2 ...)` — if all arguments are `true`
* `(when b1 b2)` — if `b1` is `true` and `b2` is `true`
or `b1` is `false`
* `(exists p)` — if `p` property exists
* `(absent p)` — if `p` property is absent
* `(zero v)` — if any `v` equals to zero
* `(eq v1 v2)` — if any `v1` equals to any `v2`
* `(lt v1 v2)` — if any `v1` is less than any `v2`
* `(gt v1 v2)` — if any `v1` is greater than any `v2`
* `(many v)` — if `v` has many values
* `(one v)` — if `v` has one value
* `(matches v s)` — if any `v` matches the `s` regular expression

There are a few terms that return non-boolean values:

* `(at i v)` is the `i`-th value of `v`
* `(size v)` is the cardinality of `v` (zero if `v` is `nil`)
* `(type v)` is the type of `v`
(`"String"`, `"Integer"`, `"Float"`, `"Time"`, or `"Array"`)
* `(either v1 v1)` is `v2` if `v1` is `nil`

It's possible to modify the facts retrieved, on fly:

* `(as p v)` adds property `p` with the value `v`
* `(join s t)` adds properties named by the `s` mask with the values retrieved
by the `t` term, for example, `(join "foo_*" (gt x 5))` will add `foo_x` and
all other properties found in the facts that match `(gt x 5)`

Also, some simple arithmetic:

* `(plus v1 v2)` is a sum of `∑v1` and `∑v2`
* `(minus v1 v2)` is a deducation of `∑v2` from `∑v1`
* `(times v1 v2)` is a multiplication of `∏v1` and `∏v2`
* `(div v1 v2)` is a division of `∏v1` by `∏v2`

One term is for meta-programming:

* `(defn f "self.to_s")` defines a new term using Ruby syntax and returns `true`
* `(undef f)` undefines a term (nothing happens if it's not defined yet),
returns `true`

There are terms that are history of search aware:

* `(prev p)` returns the value of `p` property in the previously seen fact
* `(unique p)` returns true if the value of `p` property hasn't been seen yet

The `agg` term enables sub-queries by evaluating the first argument (term)
over all available facts, passing the entire subset to the second argument,
and then returning the result as an atomic value:

* `(lt age (agg (eq gender 'F') (max age)))` selects all facts where
the `age` is smaller than the maximum `age` of all women
* `(eq id (agg (always) (max id)))` selects the fact with the largest `id`
* `(eq salary (agg (eq dept $dept) (avg salary)))` selects the facts
with the salary average in their departments

There are also terms that match the entire factbase
and must be used primarily inside the `(agg ..)` term:

* `(nth v p)` returns the `p` property of the _v_-th fact (must be
a positive integer)
* `(first p)` returns the `p` property of the first fact
* `(count)` returns the tally of facts
* `(max p)` returns the maximum value of the `p` property in all facts
* `(min p)` returns the minimum
* `(sum p)` returns the arithmetic sum of all values of the `p` property
